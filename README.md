<h1><b>Project Summary:</b></h1>

This project aims to develop a Local Food Wastage Management System to address the significant issue of food wastage while tackling food insecurity. The system provides a platform for restaurants and individuals to list surplus food, which can then be claimed by NGOs or individuals in need. This is done by using a SQL database, and a user-friendly Streamlit application.
